purchased case coachcanon dealwhat mistake leather stiff fit boxlike defeats purpose small camera thought embossed pebblegrain leather looked terrible coach logo looks bad leather inside smooth overall case seem soft enough camera ended returning lousy case even though cost picked standard canon leather case powershot excellent
bought switch lot people internet said provided excellent performance price would right indeed provide full gigabit speed even multiple lan ports hammered setup literally plug play like would expect unmanaged switch small sleak makes easy fit small spaces even super confined spaces heat non issue problem found coil_wine power brick though annoying cant hear close door entertainment center lives coil_wine probably problem specific switch
convenient cute

terms viewing quality viewing blu_ray disks lovely however trying watch tv showsmovies apps like hulu netflix dealt one many disconnection issues getting error became frustrating pain since nothing wrong internet connection everything plugged correctly could update firmware im completely sure ill say pass looking whole shebang offers need waste money merely looking blu_ray usb port connection good starter unit purchase
ipod case
cheap sometimes issue connection hold lever moves time time get pay still use time

bought use hmc works perfectly two_small hitches cons hmc plug locations swapped two_small jacks almost dont twist around end conjoined fit jacks theyve left plugged however tend stay way focus knob fixed twists far way utterly invaluable would nice also option hold current focus already set focus either autofocus focus ring camera switch knob controller manual wherever knob set jumps without keeping account pros cable quite long worried looked see lots people buy extension cable relief record button takes right amount pressure depress dont worry accidentally hitting flimsy plastic clicker knobs arent calibrated properly zoom creeping find rare thats another pro make easy readjust knobs allen wrench instructions werent poorly translated chinese theyre concise exhaustive questions reading im sure whether youll find good bad thing personally decide depends situation iris focus controls insanely precise touching knob think adjusting

seems something light
tripod bad good either pros bubble level head quick_release uses nice easy lever head rotates nicely vertical portrait position still quite stable locks head tilt panning column seem hold fairly well cons position locks legs means legs almost go horizontal state nothing keep higher angle like normal tripod small working space like luck need minimum inches across legs shorter position suction cup useless thats surprise head panning mechanism exactly small another proprietary quick_release height column adds negligible almost nil way legs lie nearly flat column extended stable tripod lowered legs wont flatten unstable gain maybe legs extended position retracted position reviewers maybe overestimating benefit extending legs attempting use tripod legs steeper less stable angle
excellent product works

purchased received yesterday skeptical ordering brackets state work cameras battery backs figured heck let say fit nikon battery_pack problem regards clearance several drilled holes mounting bar allow adjustment clearance finger grip want went center one set package fit placement flash best left ample room hands rotating bracket screw seems plenty tight night though based reviews keep eye cary allen wrench camera bag case things like single_screw bottom sticks way much likely replace one one folds like tripod_plate single_screw keep bracket stable terms rotating bottom camera textured grip stuff seems looks actual tact solved issue placing two small circle pieces velcro sides screw also bottom battery_pack small obtrusive hide tripod_plate using bracket think good investment think happy purchase
please take review grain salt needed use_old ps_keyboard thinkpad x long story adapter work every often keyboards leds caps lock etc would flash briefly second key presses would register computer looked bit like keyboard reset ended curiosity trying second older ps_keyboard got results product may fine keyboards tried mice ended keeping since allow use_old keyboard albeit periodic annoyance
synology released update basically bricked device get shares setup however access web interface without resetting entire system lose settings possibly_data due utter lack beta testing competency thing makes even worse knew yet still sending emails encouraging users update knew bricking systems said screw push anyway users like many others shut data list complex system reset lose accounts permissions youve got system also possibly_data dont know fire people clue id find different nas hacks clue comes releasing software way people recover disastrous updates

appears quality cable adequate electrical_functionality fair_price warning without several drawbacks pros cables appear structurally well made durable better average electrical_functionality cons like usb cables products sometimes function properly sometimes cables quite stiff resulting limited versatility utility flexibility simply taking account arranging cables associated hardware eg memorypc letv connections especially safe home use eg living room requiring several pieces equipment requisite electrical outletsextenders quickly become way cumbersome unless course enjoy hermits life spouse friends techiesengineersscientists matching coooool skyblue interior andor neither desire welcome children pets otherwise require several connections electrical pieces nice furniture limited space prefer safe living area etc recommend flexible cable said far tell far quality product fair_price functions least par similar alternatives
