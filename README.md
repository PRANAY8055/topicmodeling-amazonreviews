# NLP Project: topicmodeling-amazonreviews

This repository contains the code for our NLP project, which includes the development of a hybrid topic modeling approach and comparisons with traditional LDA models.

## Project Files Description

### `hybridmodel.py`

- **Purpose**: Contains the implementation of our hybrid model.
- **Details**: This script generates topics using a semi-supervised approach, which are compared to those generated by a benchmark LDA model.

### `underlying_topic_discovery.py`

- **Purpose**: Explores and identifies latent topics not captured by the LDA model.
- **Details**: This script utilizes domain knowledge through Anchor Words to uncover relevant topics that exist in the data but were overlooked by unsupervised methods.

### `lda.py`

- **Purpose**: Implements traditional unsupervised LDA topic modeling.
- **Details**: This script is used to generate topics from our dataset, serving as a baseline for comparison with our hybrid model.
