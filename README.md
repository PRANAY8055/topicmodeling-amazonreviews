The "hybridmodel.py" file has code related to creation of our hybrid model and generating topics which are similar to topics which were generated by LDA model which we are using as  a benchmark.

The "underlying_topic_discovery.py" file has code, where we explored different topics which were not generated by LDA, but existed in the data and found by using Anchor Words(domain knowledge).


The "lda.py" file has code where we use un-supervised LDA to generated topics from our dataset.
